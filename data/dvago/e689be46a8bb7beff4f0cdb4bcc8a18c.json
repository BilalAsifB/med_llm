However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.\",\"usage_and_safety\":\"Dosage Fluoromethalone\\nSide Effects Decreasing order of frequency, elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing , Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, mydriasis, conjunctival hyperemia, loss of accommodation and ptosis , allergic reactions; foreign body sensation; erythema of eyelid; eyelid edema/eye swelling; eye discharge; eye pain; eye pruritus; lacrimation increased; rash; taste perversion; visual disturbance (blurry vision); and visual field defect.\\nDrug Interactions Ritonavir, Cobicistat\\nIndication It contains a steroid which is used to treat inflammation of the eye.\\nWhen not to Use Do not use this medicine , if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to fluorometholone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine or if you have a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of the eye.\",\"precautions\":\"Precaution The use of the bottle by more than one person may spread infection.\",\"warnings\":\"Warning 1 You should not use this medicine for more than one week unless your doctor or eye specialist advises it.\\nWarning 2 Prolonged use may cause the pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure) to increase, which could lead to glaucoma, rare damage to the optic nerve, lack of clearness of vision, cataracts, delay in wound healing, or the development of an eye infection.
