It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound factor Xa and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting factor Xa, Apixaban prevents thrombin generation and thrombus development.\",\"usage_and_safety\":\"Dosage Apixaban\\nSide Effects Common: Haemorrhage, haematoma, epistaxis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, rectal haemorrhage, gingival bleeding, haematuria and contusion.
